For stripe payment, when the user buys a product, it is directed to a create checkout session hosted by Stripe.
Once checkout is complete, the checkout Id is stored in users Model.
When the webhook is succesful with response code 200, it looks for the user with the stored Id as it matches, then alters the paid status
to confirm payment for that particular user. 
#This will show for both user and admin.

#The database is seeded for instant use with an admin and a user role.
Using Identity for users and admin. When a user registers, an email is sent, along with email sent when removing account.

admin user:-
email = admin@coffee.com
password = coffee@1234

user:-
email = user@coffee.com
password = coffee1234

When admin is logged in, it has the additional benefits of altering products and users. 
Additionally, when you admin user looks at his orders, it reveals all orders from users including a status column. This is
linked to Stripe webhook which confirms payments that are made.

In orders, it will highlight green for both user and admin to assist with user experience.
